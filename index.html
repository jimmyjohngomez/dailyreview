            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Adolfo Velazquez, and I would like to talk a little bit about myself. I was born on October 5th 1999 in Denver, Colorado. 
                I have a few hobbies. One of my hobbies is playing and listening to music. The other hobby is videogames.
                Including me, there are 5 people in my family. I have a brother, a sister, and 2 parents.
                My dream vacation would be to go to Rio de Janero. Hanglide or something. I would like to visit Mexico to see my family</p>
           <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <p> My first long term goal is to create a business. It is the main reason why I am here at this school. I want my business to be big and successful. That is my dream.
                 My second long term goal is to die with no regrets. That is the longest term possible. It is nearly impossible to pull off. I feel like I could be able to pull it off</p>
                <p> my first short term goal is to pass all my classes with a C or better. That way I get accepted in to good colleges.
                 my second short term goal is to graduate. That is everyoneâ€™s goal in life, to graduate high school. </p>
            <h2 id="accomplishments"> accomplishments </h2>
                <p> a personal accomplishment of mine is that I know how to play 5 instruments</p>
                <p> I have no educational accomplishments</p>
